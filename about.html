						<h1 class="major">About Me</h1>
						<p>My name is Mike, I am a recent graduate of Software Engineering and looking for work in the field of 
							Game Development as a Gameplay / AI Programmer. I have been passionate about video games all my life, 
							 and always knew I wanted to make video games. After years of self teaching myself game development I returned to college
							 in 2020 and now having graduated I'm ready to make my dream of making games a reality!
						</p>

						<h2 style="text-align: center;">Gaming</h2>
						<hr>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/about/zelda.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>
						<p>On my third birthday I got my first introduction to gaming, with the original Gameboy and Kirby's Dreamland and ever since gaming has been one of
							my biggest passions. Growing up I always kept up on all news about upcoming games and console, I had subscriptions to several magazines and always
							loved reading about the development process. Anyone that knows me knows my love of games, it eventually got me the nickname Game Nerd, I was always 
							the go to for other kids who needed help in games or asking about new games. </p> 
							
							<p>I believe gaming is the best medium for story telling, through gaming players can experience things that would never be possible in reality.

						<hr>
						<span class="image fitmedium"><img src="images/about/metroidvania.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>
						<p>For as long as I can remember I knew I wanted to make video games. At 11 years old I would spend class time filling the empty
							portions of my school work with plans for games I wanted to make one day. I would draw out maps, make up lists of mission ideas and 
							items for in the game, I created a mini metroidvania on a scrap piece of paper. While at the time I didn't yet know how games were
							made, I wanted to learn.
						</p>
						<p>I went to computer and game dev summer camps when I was young and made my first game, an Ocarina of Time 2D side-scroller in Game Maker.
							In high school I took every tech class there was, during lunch we often had LAN matches in Halo 1 and using a map editor, I created 
							maps for us to play in. Outside of school I spent many hours watching online tutorials. Throughout my whole life I have always done whatever
							 I could to learn how to become a game developer.

						<h2 style="text-align: center;">Youtube</h2>
						<hr>
						<p>From 2013-2018, I had a gaming channel (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamnrd">https://www.youtube.com/@gamnrd</a>) on YouTube where I uploaded 670 videos. After having used YouTube since 2005, after a spontaneous 
							trip to Playlist Live in 2013, I decided to finally start creating videos. At the time I was very active on a Minecraft server called MCSG 
							(Minecraft Survival Games) so naturally I started recording my matches. After over 300 Minecraft video I later moved onto recording several 
							playthroughs of other games, then focusing on VR games before eventually leaving YouTube as a result of changes in my life.</p>
							
							<p>In my first year I got over 2,000 subscribers, collaborated with several YouTubers I had watched for years,
							 was even partnered with Maker, a large Multi-Channel Network until they were purchased by Disney. These years were definitely the highlight of my 20's, 
							 I made some amazing friends, met and worked with many creators I had watched for years, and traveled to many conventions
							 in Toronto, Anaheim, Orlando, and San Antonio. My experience with YouTube taught me about video and photo editing, self marketing, and networking.
